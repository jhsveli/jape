 1. About JAPE
--------------------------

JAPE is a save game editor for Jagged Alliance 2. JAPE allows you to
view and edit the items and attributes of your mercenaries, or any
other character in the game.

JAPE works with the following versions of Jagged Alliance 2:
 * US version 1.03      (Build 99.06.09)
 * US version 1.04      (Build 99.08.11)
 * US version 1.05r     (Build 99.09.15)
 * US version 1.06      (Build 99.11.12)
 * US version 1.07      (Build 00.05.29)
 * US version 1.12      (Build 04.12.-2)
 * US version 1.13-2085 (Build 08.04.27)
Other versions may work, but are untested.

Only stats editing is possible for version 1.13 save games, not item
editing.

-------------------------- 
 2. System Requirements
-------------------------- 

JAPE requires that you install the Sun Java runtime, version 5 or
above.  If you don't have this installed already, go to
http://www.java.com/en/download/ and get it.

--------------------------
 3. Installation
--------------------------

Extract the contents of JAPE040.ZIP into the directory where you
installed Jagged Alliance 2. Sorry, no InstallShield setup program.

--------------------------
 4. Running JAPE
--------------------------

4.1 Starting no.jts.Jape

From the desktop, create a shortcut to the file JAPE.JAR, and
double-click on the shortcut. The JAPE main window should appear. Or
from the command line, go to the Jagged Alliance directory and type
JAPE.JAR.

If you doubleclick JAPE.JAR and you get an error message saying that
"Windows cannot open this file:", then you need to install the Sun
Java runtime.  See above.

4.2 Opening a Saved Game

From the "File" menu, select "Open...". Navigate to the SavedGames
directory and select a saved game file. The saved games will be named
SaveGame01.sav, SaveGame02.sav, etc.

4.3 Editing Character Data

The left side of the JAPE window contains a list of all the editable
characters in the saved game. Characters with a * beside their name
are the mercenaries on your team. Click on the name of character, and
his/her statistics will be displayed on the right side of the window.

The middle of the JAPE windows contains detailed information on a
single character. Some information is only present for your currently
hired mercenaries. Most of the fields are editable. Go ahead, give
your custom merc 99 Marksmanship.

The right side of the JAPE windows contains information on a the
currently selected merc's equiptment. Again, this information is only
present for your currently hired team members.

4.4 Save Your Changes

Once you're happy with the changes you've made, open the "File" menu
